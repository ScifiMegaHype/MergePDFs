# How It Works
The code uses PyPDF2.PdfMerger to merge selected PDFs.

---

# What I Learnt
Funny enough, the best lesson here was learning how to ensure that the program does not open two instances at once.

---

# Future Enhancements
📄 Allowing users to select pages they want merge from each file.
